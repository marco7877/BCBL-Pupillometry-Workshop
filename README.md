# BCBL-Pupillometry-Workshop

Hello BCBLians R-code padawans. All materials here are the ones we are going to use during the Pupilometry Workshop (20-31, May, 2024).

The idea is that after this crash course we have the required R notions to become a **R Jedi-Master**. This Repo is full of memes and jokes, *padawan discretion is adviced*

**Let's start our jedi track**

## R & R-Studio

For this workshop we're going to work with the *R programming language* version ==$>=4.0$== (*Imagine each R version is a specific R pokemon evolution*. So, please make sure that you have it already installed; if not, access this [link]{https://cran.rstudio.com/} . 

We will also use an *Integrated Development Environment* (**IDE** for cool people) so that we can code with a nice Grafical User Interface (**GUI**). We will use R-studio [link]{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download}.

We are ready to start! **May the force be with you!**
